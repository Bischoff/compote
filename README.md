# WozMania: an Apple ][ emulator for ARM 64

![DOS and Basic in wozmania](/docs/wozmania-basic.png)

## Motivation

WozMania started as a toy project. I wanted to learn ARM 64 assembler,
so I wrote the core of an Apple ][ emulator as an exercise. After a while,
I realized that I was having a lot of fun, so I continued beyond
the strict minimum.


## What is done

As of 2021-05-10:

* 6502 processor, 146 instructions out of 256;
* keyboard;
* 40 column text mode;
* floppy disks 1 and 2, .nib format only;
* language card.


## Usage

See the [documentation](/docs/usage.md).


## Contributing

Help wanted:

* ideas;
* test more Apple ][ programs;
* test on more machines: Apple M1, smartphones;
* code.
