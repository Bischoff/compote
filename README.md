# WozMania: an Apple ]\[ emulator for ARM 64

![DOS and Applesoft BASIC in WozMania](/docs/applesoft.png)

## Motivation

WozMania started as a toy project. I wanted to learn ARM 64 assembler,
so I wrote the core of an Apple ]\[ emulator as an exercise. After a while,
I realized that I was having a lot of fun, so I continued beyond
the strict minimum.


## What is done

As of 2021-08-30:

* 6502 processor, no decimal mode;
* keyboard;
* video output in text mode, 40 and 80 columns;
* floppy disks 1 and 2, `.nib` format (read/write), `.dsk` format (read only);
* language card.


## Usage

See the [documentation](/docs/wozmania.md).


## Contributing

Help wanted:

* ideas;
* a nice logo;
* test more Apple ]\[ programs;
* port to other platforms: Apple M1, Android;
* code.
