* floppy disk support:
  - other disk formats than .nib
* screen modes:
  - 80 columns text
  - low resolution graphic
  - mixed low resolution graphic/text
  - high resolution graphic
* more hardware emulation:
  - printer
  - serial card
  - sound
  - game paddles
* what about other Apple II models?

Items at risk of becoming moot when we run in a window:

* command-line options:
  - to disable disks
  - to load 16 sectors controller ROM
  - to disable the language card
  - to control speed
* keyboard:
  - nano timer to receive ESC key
* floppy disk support:
  - function key to flush the disk immediately
  - function key to hot-load a floppy into a drive
