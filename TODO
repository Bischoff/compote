                       TO DO

* known bugs:
  - floppy: DOS 3.3 INIT command hangs
    (verification at VTRACK routine fails)
  - screen: characters are not flashing like on a
    real Apple ][
* keyboard:
  - nano timer to receive ESC key
* 80 column support:
  - display cursor
* 40 column support;
  - refresh screen at TEXT <-> GR changes
  - refresh screen at 80 col <-> 40 changes,
    including right part of the screen
* floppy disk support:
  - function key and menu item to hot-load a floppy
    into a drive
  - more disk formats (ProDOS, etc.)
* configuration:
  - find a way to control speed (for games)
    in addition to the `keyboard_poll_ratio` setting
  - allow to configure the retry delay
    for the Linux socket?
* Graphical User Interface:
  - blinking characters
  - high resolution graphics
* more hardware emulation:
  - game paddles
  - printer
  - serial card
  - Thunderclock Plus card
  - sound
* what about other Apple II models?
