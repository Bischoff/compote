* floppy disk support:
  - write to .dsk file
* screen modes:
  - 80 columns text
  - low resolution graphic
  - mixed low resolution graphic/text
  - high resolution graphic
* more hardware emulation:
  - printer
  - serial card
  - sound
  - game paddles
* find a way to control speed (for games)
* what about other Apple II models?

Items at risk of becoming moot when we run in a window:

* keyboard:
  - nano timer to receive ESC key
* floppy disk support:
  - function key to flush the disk immediately
  - function key to hot-load a floppy into a drive
