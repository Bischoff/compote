             TO DO

* bugs:
  - floppy: DOS 3.3 INIT command hangs
    (verification at VTRACK routine fails)
  - 80 column: some characters replaced by space
* keyboard:
  - nano timer to receive ESC key
* 80 column support:
  - display cursor
* floppy disk support:
  - function key and menu item to hot-load a floppy
    into a drive
  - more disk formats (ProDOS, etc.)
* configuration:
  - find a way to control speed (for games)
    in addition to the `keyboard_poll_ratio` setting
* screen modes:
  - low resolution graphics
  - mixed low resolution graphics/text
  - high resolution graphics
* Graphical User Interface:
  - blinking characters
  - status bar
* more hardware emulation:
  - printer
  - serial card
  - sound
  - game paddles
* what about other Apple II models?
